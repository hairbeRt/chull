# What is this?
A very small and simple (and theoretically optimal) algorithm to compute convex hull in two dimensions. x-Coordinates of points must be distinct (if not, add small noise).
Just play around with it as you like.

# Question
For n points that are normal-distributed in the 2D-plane, what is the expected length of the boundary of the convex hull? Any nontrivial upper/lower asymptotic bounds?
